    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>I am a test Automation Engineer with many years of testing experience.<br>
        I have been involved in the testing of many different projects, ranging 
        from well-established products to helping out with the early stages of major new initiatives. 
        I excel at solving automation problems in a team environment and has been involved in traditional 
        automation initiatives at various stages. I have also helped to improve product quality through 
        the creative use of automation tools and by helping build out automation frameworks. 
        I have a desire to see teams efficiently producing high value software and is 
        enthusiastic about understanding the ways that automation tools can be used to 
        help with this goal. Currently, I work as a test Automation Engineer at Westat.
